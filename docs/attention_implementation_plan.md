# Attention Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- Model using 1024x1024 input resolution
- Concerns about mobile deployment
- Need to evaluate impact of attention mechanisms
- Need to test different resolutions

## Key Decisions
1. **Attention Implementation**
   - Will implement both spatial and channel attention
   - Will add attention modules to FPN levels
   - Will use selective attention to reduce computation

2. **Resolution Optimization**
   - Need to test 512x512 and 256x256 resolutions
   - Will implement progressive processing
   - Will evaluate minimum viable resolution

## Implementation Steps
1. **Initial Testing (GPU Workstation)**
   - Test different resolutions (1024, 512, 256)
   - Measure tick size in pixels at each resolution
   - Evaluate detection accuracy
   - Document memory usage and computation time

2. **Attention Integration**
   - Add attention modules to model
   - Implement selective attention
   - Test with different resolutions
   - Measure performance impact

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Implement progressive processing
   - Add mobile-specific optimizations
   - Test on target devices
   - Measure battery impact

## Files to Modify
1. `src/model.py`
   - Add attention modules
   - Modify input resolution
   - Implement progressive processing

2. `src/dataset.py`
   - Add resolution handling
   - Implement progressive loading

3. `src/evaluate_model.py`
   - Add resolution testing
   - Add performance metrics
   - Add memory usage tracking

## Testing Plan
1. **Resolution Testing**
   - Test each resolution (1024, 512, 256)
   - Measure tick size in pixels
   - Evaluate detection accuracy
   - Document memory usage

2. **Attention Testing**
   - Test with and without attention
   - Measure performance impact
   - Evaluate memory usage
   - Document training time

3. **Mobile Testing**
   - Test on target devices
   - Measure inference time
   - Evaluate battery impact
   - Test memory usage

## Success Metrics
1. **Performance**
   - Detection accuracy at each resolution
   - Inference time on mobile devices
   - Memory usage on mobile devices
   - Battery impact

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Training time
   - Memory usage
   - Model size
   - Computation requirements

## Next Steps
1. Set up testing environment on GPU workstation
2. Implement resolution testing
3. Add attention mechanisms
4. Test and optimize for mobile deployment

## Notes
- Current tick size in 1024x1024: ~20-50 pixels
- Expected tick size in 512x512: ~10-25 pixels
- Expected tick size in 256x256: ~5-12 pixels
- Attention should help maintain accuracy at lower resolutions
- Progressive processing can balance speed and accuracy

## Questions to Address
1. What is the minimum resolution needed for accurate tick detection?
2. How much does attention improve detection at lower resolutions?
3. What is the optimal balance between resolution and performance?
4. How can we best implement progressive processing?
